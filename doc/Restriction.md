# Restriction

VEO does not support:
 - to use quadruple precision real number a variable length character string 
   as a return value and an argument of Fortran subroutines and functions,
 - to use multiple VEs by a VH process,
 - to re-create a VE process after the destruction of the VE process, and
 - to call API of VE DMA or VH-VE SHM on the VE side if VEO API is called from child thread on the VH side.

The current veo_context_close() implementation remains threads on the VE side glibc when calling veo_context_close().
